## Introduction

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python 3, designed to run in the terminal window. Put your word-solving skills to the test by guessing the hidden word before it's too late!

## How to Play

Choose a Word Category: Start by selecting a word category from a variety of options. Whether you're into animals, plants, or countries, there's a few optios for you to choose from.

Guess the Word: Once you've chosen a category, the game will select a random secret word from that category, and it's your job to guess it. You'll see the number of letters represented by stars (*), and your task is to reveal the word letter by letter.

Make Your Guesses: Enter individual characters to guess the word. If the character is part of the word, it will be revealed in its correct position. If not, you'll inch closer to the hangman's demise.

Win Before the Final Turn: The objective is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses, so choose your letters wisely!
